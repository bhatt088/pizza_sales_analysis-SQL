ðŸš€ What can a pizza dataset teach you about business intelligence? A lot more than you'd expect.

I recently completed a hands-on SQL project that analyzed pizza sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that could help any food business make smarter decisions.

ðŸ“Š This wasnâ€™t just about writing queriesâ€”it was about thinking like a data analyst and translating raw numbers into strategic value.

Hereâ€™s what I tackled:

Identified the top 5 most-ordered pizzas (yes, the classics win).

Analyzed revenue by pizza type and category to spot top performers.

Discovered peak order timesâ€”helpful for staffing and inventory planning.

Built cumulative revenue tracking over time to highlight growth trends.

ðŸ’¡ Why this project? I wanted to move beyond textbook problems and simulate how real businesses use data to drive operations and growth. The pizza industry was a fun, relatable lens to practice core analytical skillsâ€”like asking the right questions, structuring clean queries, and interpreting the results in a business context.

This project sharpened my SQL, but more importantly, it strengthened how I approach data storytelling, business thinking, and insight generation.
